(Everyone Present).

### Unfinished tasks:
- There were no unfinished tasks for sprint 3.

### What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint

- Although this is our last sprint, we well always keep these good practices
in mind during future developments.
- Start the sprint work early. This way there is a buffer at the end for surprise changes, and bugs.
- Conduct standups frequently (even more than required). This way everyone is up to date with what everyone else is doing.
    - This also allows us to help each other if someone is having difficulty with a task. 
- Explore new technology when implementing features.
    - There is a good chance the someone else has experienced the same issues. 
    - The react platform lends itself to a good package manager, thus there might be a library to address the issue.
    - Using an optimized library will allow for more efficient and elegant code. It will also reduce overall time spent on tasks.
- Always share concerns with the rest of the team, with out being ashamed of sounding silly or being belittled.
- Focus on user interface more as even if we make a very powerful feature, it is useless if the user can't interact with it and use it according to their needs.    

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint
- Although this was our last sprint, some new practices include:
- Ask for help from other teammates when needed.
- Ask the product owner for an opinion on significant decisions.
- Ask the TAs for help.
- Plan out designs collectively before execution. 
    - There were instances where some members had to change their implementation because the design was not clear
- Use styling templates as they are optimized for the best user experience, when necessary.
- Always make sure to recursively update the database, when data is being deleted, other wise junk or redundant data fills up the database.
- Use online drawing tools to share thoughts about new UI designs as it helps to portray more information to the rest of the team.
- Give team members tasks that are different from those, they have undertaken in the last sprint, so that they have a better idea of the application as a whole. Specialize only when necessary.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint
- There were no harmful practices in this sprint.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3
- The best experience was seeing our platform slowly develop into something functional.
- Worst experience, making sure that all documentation was completed.
- The UI has been improved tremendously, and almost all our tasks are coming to an end in due time.
