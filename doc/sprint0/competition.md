# Possible Competition

## Existing Products
- [Google Classroom]  [https://edu.google.com/intl/en_ca/products/classroom/]
- [Quercus] [https://q.utoronto.ca]
- [Zoom] [https://zoom.us]


## Why our product is different
- The users in our use cases are specific to the project. The platforms mentioned above are more general applications and it hard to navigate through multiple apps and keep track of relevant related information through different applications. With a centralized application that allows classroom-based events, as well as video conferencing and community discussions, African Entrepreneurs are at an advantage while using our application, in comparison to managing their status on multiple applications across their network.


## How our product focuses on specific users
- These existing platforms are tailored for generic needs. For example, google classroom is suited for general teacher and student interaction. This goes hand in hand with Quercus as well. For our specific users, which in this case are African Entrepreneurs, as well as teachers, our application allows these users to have more freedom with the way they interact with other Entrepreneurs. They don't necessarily need to be in the same "class", they can have the same interests and be able to communicate to each other straight forwardly. This can be done via dm's or even the browsing section that we plan to implement where entrepreneurs can showcase their demo products/ideas.

## Why competitors didn't focus on these users/scenarios
- The reason for this is due to the scalability aspect of these companies. Companies such as Google, zoom, Quercus aid tens of thousands to millions of users. In their case, it wouldn't be reasonable to design an application so specific that only one out of their hundreds of target user groups would be able to use the application to the best of their needs.
- For them to focus more on specific target groups, they would need designated teams to handle all of these groups, but realistically this wouldn't be feasible as their goal is to maximize revenue/customers.
