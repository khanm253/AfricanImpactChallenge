## A)Team Organization:

To organize our team and divide roles amongst ourselves we held a meeting on discord.
The process involved everyone in the team introducing themselves and doing short presentations their skills in terms of the programming languages they are familiar with and tools they have used in their previous workterms.

Following this step, we decided to note down the tech stack that we all would be comfortable in using
for the project in round robin fashion, and chose the tech most of us were comfortable in using. 

Using information from the sessions described above we decided to divide roles among our teammates as follows:

1)Mustafa Hafeez: Organizational tools management(Jira and Agile), agile specialist and Backend javascript development.
2)Muhammad Saad Reza: UX specialist, backend javascript development and project deadline management.
3)Smit Patel: Version control management, UX specialist and database integration management.
4)Anis Saha: Customer Coordinator, backend development and responsible for testing.
5)Abdullah Khan: Backend development, database integration management and responsible for testing.

## B)Decision making:

Step 1: For decision making on a specific issue, we allow the teammate who is most familiar with it; to present it to the rest of the team. 

Step 2: Following this step, we go around the team in round robin fashion and allow them to express their opinions on the issue, upon which, every other teammate then has to give a point out of 10, that would rate how much they like the suggestion from their respective colleague.

Step 3: Based on comparing the points from the teammates, we will decide to use the suggestion that has attained the most points, as a solution to the concerned problem. 

Step 4: Next, the customer coordinator will be responsible with presenting our decision to the 
customer/TA(scrum master) whose feedback is valuable to us, as we are working under a customer driven framework. 

Conclusion : Upon the collection of feedback, we will discuss the possible changes that need to be made to our decision using the same methods discussed above and reach a conclusion.

## C)Prioritizing user stories:

Overview: To prioritize user stories, we have decided to use the story point system along with values from the Fibonacci pattern(1,1,2,3,5,8). When assigning points to the first few tasks, we chose the 'user authentication' user story as a relative measure as we collectively decided that we are all familiar with the amount of effort required to implement this feature. Every team member decided to give the user story a point score of 8, to be used as a relative measure when introducing points to the first few user stories.

Also, it is Important to mention that we are assigning points to the user stories based on the difficulty of the tasks and not velocity, as it accurately represents the amount of work that should be put into the task.The steps required for prioritizing are as follows:

Step 1: Choose a user story.

Step 2: We will move along the whole team in Round Robin fashion and each team member will be responsible to assign a story point to the selected user story
by comparing it to the the difficulty measured in story points of other tasks(for example by comparing with the user auth task to begin with). Each member will also
get the opportunity to provide valuable suggestions on the nature/implementation procedure of the user story, from previous experiences.

Step 3: We will perform 2 short voting sessions as described above. This will allow the team members to project their thoughts an opinions on the selected user story and will provide the assignee with a lot of valuable information. Also, the opinions of colleagues may answer the doubts of other team mates, and the amount of story points they
assigned in the second voting session. 

Step 4: Lastly, using the deciding strategy described in Part B, we will collectively choose the most applicable story point for the user story,from the ones that are most common. 

Step 5: If a particular task is too difficult, denoted by story points of 20+, we will split the user story into multiple sub-stories and assign story points to each of them.

## D)Meeting Plan:

Location: We will be using the private discord server that we have linked in our team.md file for our meetings.

Strategy: We have decided to join meetings on 3 days every week, with on day in between every two standups.

Agenda:In each standup, all of the team members will be responsible for saying 
       -What they have accomplished since the last standup
       -What problems/bloackages they have encountered
       -Review results from tests/ automated builds.
       -Assigning new user stories
       -Tracking overall process.

Days of the week: Monday Wednesday Friday

Timing: 4:30 pm on every assigned date.

Duration: The meetings will usually be for 30 minutes and upto 15 minutes will be added for 
          'Parking Lot' = discussions on specific topics.

Sprint Planning: Hosted biweekly on Mondays, as a part of the usual standup extended for 15 mins to plan for the upcoming sprint and discuss what we have completed in the previous sprint.

## E)Lessons for next phases:

-Clarify questions in mind, immediately during meetings:
 Often, questions arise in our minds when our team mates are talking. It is important to clarify such questions at one point in the meeting since it may be valuable for the whole team and prevent having a mismatch in concepts in our minds. For the upcoming sprints, we have decided that we will allocate a 5min window at the end of the standups to clarify such questions, that we are individually responsible for noting down as soon as they arise.

-Always sketch out UI for better understanding:
 During our first few meetings, we realized that most of is had different views on how the UI structure. This mismatch in views, led to a lot of confusions within the team.For the upcoming meetings, we have decided to use wireframe for simple UI sketching during meetings. This will ensure that all of our views match and that no mismatch in design occurs later down the line.

-Always use the 'project overview handout' as reference when making high level design decisions:
 Since we are working under a customer driven framework, it is important that our software matches with the customer's best interest. Using the project overview handout provided by the African challenge team allowed us to closely follow the details provided in it and make our initial model match with the description of 'Community and E-learning'platform provided in the handout. We will certainly use this handout as a guide throughout the development of our project and team member responsible will further clarify our doubts by attending customer office hours, throughout the semester.

-Listening is as important as talking:
 Since we are working as a team, it is important to actively listen to what our team members are saying during their turns and make notes of important points. This ensures that we are familiar with the progress of the team as a whole and a good way of dealing with common development problems within the team. We will certainly use this practice throughout the semester.

-Strictly follow the decision strategy:
 When making decisions, it is important to strictly follow the decision strategy as described in PART B. This keeps the decision making process short and concise, while allowing every team member to project their opinions equally. For the upcoming sprints we will abide by this rule when we are making important decisions as it saves up a lot of discussion time and supports every team members' best interests.
