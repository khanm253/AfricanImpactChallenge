# Sprint Retrospective 2

## Meeting Information:

### Participants: 
- Smit Patel
- Anis Saha
- Mustafa Hafeez
- Saad Raza
- Abdullah Khan
(Everyone Present).

### Unfinished tasks:
- CLOUD-19: As a logged in user i want to add submissions for assignments that i am required to complete
- Initially, we thought we could get around to this task near the end of the sprint. Unfortunately, the other tasks had a lot of dependencies on each other and it took more time to restructure the database, and our initial approach needed to be changed.

### What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint

- Start the sprint work early. This way there is a buffer at the end for surprise changes, and bugs.
- Conduct standups frequently (even more than required). This way everyone is up to date with what everyone else is doing.
    - This also allows us to help each other if someone is having difficulty with a task. 
- Explore new technology when implementing features.
    - There is a good chance the someone else has experienced the same issues. 
    - The react platform lends itself to a good package manager, thus there might be a library to address the issue.
    - Using an optimized library will allow for more efficient and elegant code. It will also reduce overall time spent on tasks.

- Test your code thoroughly and make more commits.   

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint
- Ask for help from other teammates when needed.
- Ask the product owner for an opinion on significant decisions.
- Ask the TAs for help.
- Plan out designs collectively before execution. 
    - There were instances where some members had to change their implementation because the design was not clear.
- We will do point distribution with more care as some tasks took longer than expected

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint
- We started our standups late and committed to our tasks a bit late.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
- The best experience was seeing our platform slowly develop into something functional.
- Worst experience, making sure that all documentation was completed.
