## Team Capacity: 

The total points targeted to be completed by the end of this sprint are 56. We wish to complete around 50-60 points in our next sprint too. Our main focus for the next sprint will be to add the finishing details, ensure that the application is running smoothly, and finishing the remaining 2 stories. 

## Spikes:

The only obstacle in the sprint is that we all have midterms and assignments for courses other than CSCC01. This will mean that we all will start the work for this sprint late. No other spikes as all the user stories have been given appropriate points and have been distributed.
