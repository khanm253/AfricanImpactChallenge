## Sprint Goals:

The main focus of this sprint was to implement important features, set up navigation and organize the backend for the 
two main parts of our application, which are 1) Community 2) E-learning. Also, we wanted to make the application more customizable and more specifc to the role of the logged in users. We aimed to get a significant chunk of user stories done from the Product Backlog in this sprint so that we can focus on styling in the upcoming sprint.

## Team Capacity: 

The total points targeted to be completed by the end of this sprint is 60. We wish to complete 60 points in our next sprint
and will be targetting similar points for the upcoming sprints. Our main focus for the next sprint will be to focus on the styling of out application and implementing the unfinished tasks from this sprint.

## Spikes:

The only obstacle in the sprint is that we all have midterms for courses other than CSCC01. This will mean that we all will start the work for this sprint late. No other spikes as all the user stories have been given appropriate points and have been 
distributed.
