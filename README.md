# Cloud Engineers

## Motivation 
This project is a web application that provides a platform for participants in the African Impact Challenge. Participants will be able to use the platform to communicate with their peers, and access e-learning resources. The application was made so that participants have an integrated experience between the e-learning and community aspects of the African Impact Challenge.

## Installation
The web application is made using [_react_](https://reactjs.org/), so the prerequisites are to have both [_nodejs_](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [_npm_](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. To build the project:
```shell
# cd into the root directory of the project
npm run build
```

## Contribution
We use the git-flow workflow for merging and managing code in the repository. The name of the branches as per git flow are
1. main
2. hotfix
3. release
4. develop
5. feature

The features branches follow the following naming convention of _feature\_{name_of_feature_separated_by_underscores}_. We use Jira for tracking issues and to merge a feature branch into the develop branch requires a pull request that needs to be approved by atleast 2 group members.
